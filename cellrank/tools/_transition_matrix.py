    """
    High level function to compute a transition matrix based on a combination
    of RNA Velocity and transcriptomic similarity.

    To learn more about the way in which the transition matrices are computed, see
    :class:`cellrank.tl.kernels.VelocityKernel` for the velocity-based transition matrix and
    :class:`cellrank.tl.kernels.ConnectivityKernel` for the transcriptomic-similarity-based transition matrix.

    Params
    ------
    adata: :class:`anndata.AnnData`
        Annotated data object.
    vkey
        Key from :paramref:`adata` `.layers` to access the velocities.
    backward
        Direction of the process.
    weight_connectivities
        Weight given to transcriptomic similarities as opposed to velocities. Must be in `[0, 1]`.
    sigma_corr
        Scaling parameter for the softmax. Larger values will lead to a more concentrated distribution (more peaked).
        Default is to use 1/median_velocity_correlation
    density_normalize
        Whether to use density correction when computing the transition probabilities.
        Density correction is done as by [Haghverdi16]_.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`cellrank.tl.KernelExpression`
        A kernel expression object.

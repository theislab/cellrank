CellRank: dynamics from multi-view single-cell data
===================================================

**CellRank** :cite:`lange:22` is a modular framework to study cellular dynamics based on Markov state modeling of
multi-view single-cell data. It estimates differentiation direction based on a varied (and growing!) number of
biological priors including RNA velocity, pseudotime, developmental potential and experimental time points.
See :doc:`about CellRank <about/index>` to learn more.

CellRank scales to large cell numbers, is fully compatible with the `scverse`_ ecosystem, and is easy to use. In the
backend, it is powered by the `pyGPCCA package <https://github.com/msmdev/pyGPCCA>`_ :cite:`reuter:19,reuter:22`. Feel
free to open an `issue`_ or send us an `email <mailto:info@cellrank.org>`_ if you encounter a bug, need our help or just
want to make a comment/suggestion.

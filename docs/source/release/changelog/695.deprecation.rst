I've added `DeprecationWarning` for all high-level `cellrank.tl` functions + added notes to API in docs saying that:
1. high-level API will be removed in `2.0`
2. `cellrank.tl.kernels` -> `cellrank.kernels`
3. `cellrank.tl.estimators` -> `cellrank.estimators`
4. `cellrank.ul.models` -> `cellrank.models`

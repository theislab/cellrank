# (if they are needed) will be normalized to 1 automatically. This effect will be shown after the transition matrix
# has been computed.

# We can also build more complex kernel expression. Note that multiple usage of the same kernel instance in the

# For complex expression like the one above, one can get the unique base kernels as follows.

# Kernels can also be inverted (i.e. the ``backward`` attribute is set to the opposite value to the current one).
# Note that this operation does *NOT* create a copy and modifies the kernel inplace, most importantly, the computed
# transition matrix is removed. This makes it more easier to recompute the transition matrix of kernels,
# since the handles point to the original objects.
#
# Note that in the 2nd :func:`print` statement, we access the private attribute -
# that's because accessing :paramref:`cellrank.tl.kernels.Kernel.transition_matrix` computes the transition matrix
# with default values. This happens only with basic kernels and not the kernel expressions and only if they are not part
# of a larger expression.

# The transition matrix can be written to :class:`anndata.AnnData` object. It is saved in the ``.obsp`` attribute.

# Precomputed kernel doesn't require :mod:`anndata` object - a dummy one will be created if none is supplied.

# absorption probabilities using :meth:`cellrank.tl.estimators.BaseEstimator.compute_absorption_probabilities`.

"""
Plot aggregated cellular fates
------------------------------

This example shows how to aggregate fate probabilities from the single cell level to a cluster level
and how to visualize these in various ways.

# We can visualize the aggregate absorption probabilities as a bar plot. The whiskers correspond to the standard error
# of the mean.

# Similarly, the aggregate information can be visualized using a heatmap or a clustermap.

# Violin plots are helpful to visualize the distribution of fate probabilities per cluster.
# It is also possible to restrict this plot only to a subset of clusters using the ``clusters`` parameter.
cr.pl.cluster_fates(adata, mode="violin", cluster_key="clusters")

# %%
# We can also plot the PAGA graph, using an UMAP embedding while visualizing the aggregate absorption probabilities
# as pie charts.
#
# However, using :func:`scvelo.tl.paga` and :mod:`cellrank`'s initial and terminal state probabilities, we can also
# visualize a directed version of PAGA, see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plotting_plot_directed_paga.py`.

# Lastly, we can visualize the absorption probabilities in PAGA graph by coloring the nodes.

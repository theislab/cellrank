"""
Plot gene trends
----------------

This example shows how to plot smoothed gene expression toward specific terminal populations.

By default, we use Generalized Additive Models (`GAMs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model>`_)
to fit gene expression values and we specify each cellâ€™s contribution to each lineage via the lineage probabilities.

For models based on :mod:`sklearn` estimators, see :class:`cellrank.ul.models.SKLearnModel`.

# First, we compute the terminal states and the absorption probabilities towards them.
# The absorption probabilities will be used as weights in the loss function when fitting the GAMs.
